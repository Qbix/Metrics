for invites:

1) make it invitedCount, visitedCount, participatingCount, leftCount (add up last two to get # participated)
2) invite should have invitedCount (this is maxCount, if nonzero then it enforces a limit on acceptedCount -- but not visitedCount), visitedCount, acceptedCount
3) don't need user for visiting invite, but store sessionIds and only increment if sessionId is new.
4) we need streams_invite_visit, we can just use Users/vote for this, so get totals and averages, and then just update visitedCount (and redirect)

1) increment invitedCount on stream itself, for rawUserIds, if not token
2) for the token approach, invite with token can have extra "maxCount"
3) we need Streams_Invite extra "viewedCount" (not accepted necessarily), do it one per session, and store which invites you visited, in the session
4) when an invite is accepted, update extra "acceptedCount" in addition to quotas
